**Key Endpoints Used:**
- `/agents` - Agent status and basic info
- `/calls` - Call records with duration, status, results
- `/campaigns` - Campaign data for filtering

**Data Flow:**
1. Fetch agent list and current status
2. Retrieve call records for specified time period
3. Calculate metrics (hit rate, average talk time, productivity)
4. Process trends and changes over time

### Pipedrive API

3. Analyze pipeline progression
4. Link with Adversus data via user mapping

### User Mapping
The system links Adversus agents with Pipedrive users through:
- Database mapping table
- Environment variable configuration
- Manual admin assignment

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:

```bash
# Adversus Configuration
ADVERSUS_API_URL="https://api.adversus.dk"
ADVERSUS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
ADVERSUS_WEBHOOK_SECRET="webhook-secret"

# Pipedrive Configuration
PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
PIPEDRIVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="webhook-secret"

# User Mapping
USER_ID_MAPPING="ADV001:123,ADV002:124,ADV003:125"
```
